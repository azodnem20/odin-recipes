    <h1>Pork Menudo</h1>
    <p> Pork Menudo is the number one on the list of my comfort foods and it's hard for me to last a month without trying one literally. Some would say that I am addicted to this food while others would use the term “obsession”, I just simply look at it as a necessity a basic necessity that I cannot live without.</p>
    <p> No party is complete without Pork Menudo! Chock-full of tender pork, garbanzo beans, vegetables, and raisins in a thick tomato sauce, this classic Filipino stew is hearty and tasty and will easily feed a large crowd.</p>
    <p> In the U.S., menudo usually refers to a spicy Mexican soup made with chunks of tripe in a chili-infused broth.

        However, the recipe here is the Filipino version, a colorful stew of pork or chicken, liver, potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, garbanzo beans, and raisins in rich tomato gravy. A popular dish for family dinners and special occasions, it's usually enjoyed with steamed rice.</p>
